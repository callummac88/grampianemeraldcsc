<h3>The Grampian Emerald CSC Committee</h3>    
<p>Welcome to the Grampian Emerald Celtic Supporters Club. We have been in existence since 1985 and celebrated our 25th anniversary with a dinner dance in the Douglas Hotel a few years ago.</p>

<p>We are the largest CSC in the North-East of Scotland with in excess of 150 regulars and run buses to all home and most away games in Scotland. Our policy is simple: to provide regular affordable travel to watch the Bhoys in action and to bring together Celtic fans who live or work in the area in a friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p>Throughout its lifetime the Grampian Emerald has stayed close to Celtic Football Club’s charitable roots by donating money to a wide range of organisations in the North-East including CLAN, Friends of Roxburghe House and many more local charities.</p>

<p>Our recent activities have included organising a trip with Central Coaches for 25 local school children to visit Celtic Park as part of the “Kano Foundation” and donating money to the “Good Child Foundation”, as well as annual donations to various other good causes.</p>

<p>Why don’t you come along and play your part in the future of our club, as new members are always welcome regardless of creed or colour.</p>

<h4>The present committee are as follows:</h4>
<li><p>President: Garry McNulty</p></li>
<li><p>Treasurer: Alan Swanson</p></li>
<li><p>Secretary: Tony Joseph</p></li>
<li><p>Committee Members: Holly McKenzie, Kenny McKenzie & Kerry McKay</p></li>
